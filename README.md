  <h1>LeetCode Docs</h1>
  <p>A Node.js CLI to help me with creating testing environments for LeetCode problems with documentation.</p>
</div>

## Overview
While studying LeetCode problems, I had two issues:
1. Lack of autocomplete and code snippets in LeetCode editors
2. Making notes about how I solved the problems

In order to solve this, I created this CLI and repo that does two things:
1. Creates a dedicated TypeScript environment for me to run and test problems
2. Creates a markdown file where I can make notes about the problem
